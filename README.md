# How does Appluck increase revenue for developers in the 'Incentive Video' scenario?
## Scene One: Regular Incentive Video Replacement
### 1. Scene Description  
The "rewarded video" scene has now become a standard scene for developers to monetize, but as the number of requests increases, the eCPM of various advertising platforms will experience different levels of decline.   
At this time, replacing some of the display timing of rewarded videos with Appluck interactive ads is a good choice to enhance overall monetization.
### 2. Access Case  
The following video is an example of a developer integrating Appluck in an incentive video scenario.

  1. After triggering the timing of the incentive video display, when the user  enter the reward scene
